This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
df <- read.csv('train.csv')
df.sampe <- read.csv('sampleSubmission.csv')
```

Summarize the dataset.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(df)
```

Let's see the target category.

```{r}
levels(df$Category)
```

And the submission colnames.

```{r}
colnames(df.samp)

```

Need to convert Category to sample submission format.

```{r}
df$Category <- sapply(df$Category, function (x) {
  sub(' ', '.', x)
})

```

```{r}

```
